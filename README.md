Q1: Data ops:
Data Ops is a collection of technical practices, workflows, cultural norms, and architectural patterns that enable: 

1.	Rapid innovation and experimentation delivering new insights to customers with increasing velocity
2.	Extremely high data quality and very low error rates
3.	Collaboration across complex arrays of people, technology, and environments
4.	Clear measurement, monitoring, and transparency of results

enable consistent, automated, and secure data management. It is a delivery system based on joining and analyzing large databases, Data Ops's purpose is to be a cross-functional way of working in terms of the acquisition, storage, processing, quality monitoring, execution, betterment, and delivery of information to the end-user. It harnesses the individuals’ capacities of working for the common good and business development.

The difference between data ops and dev ops:
DevOps involves continuous development of software. It tries to reduce the development lifecycle through continuous delivery. DevOps is complimentary with the agile development methodology, and by improving the delivery time, DevOps increases time to value. This makes for more profitable and rapid software development programs.

Data Ops involves continuous improvement of data quality and reduction in cycle time of data analytics. It uses the agile methodology but it isn’t tied to using any specific software. Having matured over the last decade, the Data Ops methodology is a new and rapidly growing approach to data analytics.
•	With DevOps, it’s the code that’s the important thing. But with Data Ops, data is the important aspect.
•	With DevOps, the majority of work is done by engineers who are involved in developing the code. However, with Data Ops, it’s the end-user who gets value from the data.
•	DevOps involves mostly technical people. But with Data ops, you involve business users and stakeholders too. And they aren't thinking in code and tech terms – they're more concerned with business outcomes.
•	Continuous inspection of data is key with Data Ops but doesn’t come into play with DevOps. The question with Data Ops that consistently arises is: ‘How do I know the data in the pipeline isn’t faulty or tainted?’
•	DevOps requires fairly limited coordination – you just need the team of developers to work together. However, Data Ops requires the consistent coordination of changing data (and everyone who works with it) across the entire organization.
Q2:
Integration is all about the connecting and moving of data, so that it can be safely stored and used to help you run your business and make decisions. Good integration distributes good data through your systems.
 it’s all down to data. AI and ML might sound futuristic and sci-fi but the hardest part of getting value from these technologies comes from supplying them with good training and testing data.
And seeing as good integration means a good flow of data, businesses with good integration systems are well placed to enhance their data processing via AI and ML.
Q3:
Continuous integration is a step in which all code is merged as developers complete code in order to run automated builds and tests. 
Continuous deployment is the process of moving software that has been built and tested successfully into production.
Q4:
Q5:
A differential allows for the development of a maximum outcome. For training, differential means using multiple variables in human situations and building skills in practiced responses to those situations.
